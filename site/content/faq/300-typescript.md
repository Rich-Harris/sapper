question: How do I use TypeScript with Sapper?
---

If you're a Rollup user, you can run `node ./scripts/setupTypeScriptRollup.js`, which is provided in the template, after first starting a new project.

You can also take a look at [templates that community members have created](https://github.com/sveltejs/integrations#sapper-templates-boilerplates) with TypeScript support.
