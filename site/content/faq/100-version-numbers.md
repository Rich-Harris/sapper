question: Sapper is not 1.0 yet. Is it production ready and should I use it?
---

The version number reflects that there are major features we'd like to add still. E.g. TypeScript support was added in Sapper 0.28.

Sapper is operationally stable. For example, some of the Svelte maintainers run their businesses on Sapper.
