title: Building
---

Up until now we've been using `sapper dev` to build our application and run a development server. But when it comes to production, we want to create a self-contained optimized build.

### sapper build

This command packages up your application into the `__sapper__/build` directory. (You can change this to a custom directory, as well as controlling various other options â€” do `sapper build --help` for more information.)

The output is a Node app that you can run from the project root:

```bash
node __sapper__/build
```

### Browser support

By default, Sapper builds your site only for the latest versions of modern evergreen browsers.

If you are using Rollup, you can use the `--legacy` flag to build two bundles: one for modern browsers and one for legacy browsers like Internet Explorer[1]. Sapper will then serve up the correct bundle[2] at runtime.

You may wish to add this flag to a script in your `package.json`:
```
  "scripts": {
    "build": "sapper build --legacy",
  },
```

You will also need to polyfill APIs that are not present in older browsers.
